LYAH Ch 7 Notes:

Loosely coupled - code separated in self-contained modules which don't rely on each other too much

> import Data.List
>
> numUniques :: (Eq a) => [a] -> Int
> numUniques = length . nub

:m - loads modules in ghci
ghci> :m + Data.List Data.Map Data.Set  


> import Data.List (nub, sort)  -- imports only nub and sort
> import Data.List hiding (nub)  -- hides nub, shows all others

> import qualified Data.Map as M  -- to reference Data.Map's filter function, we just use M.filter


Functions in Data.List:

intersperse - takes an element and a list and puts that element in between each element in the list
	ghci> intersperse 0 [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
	>     [1,0,2,0,3,0,4,0,5,0,6]  

intercalate - [a] -> [[a]] -> [b]. It inserts [a] in between the lists of [[a]] then combines them into [b]
	ghci> intercalate " " ["hey","there","folks"]  
	>     "hey there folks"

transpose - combines the first elements of a list of lists, then the second element, then the third..
	ghci> transpose [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]  
	>     [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]] 

foldl' and foldl1' - for when the lazy versions dont work

concat - flattens a list of lists into a list of elements
	ghci> concat [[3,4,5],[2,3,4],[2,1,1]]  
	>     [3,4,5,2,3,4,2,1,1]

concatMap - same as maping a function to a list
	ghci> concatMap (replicate 4) [1..3]  
	>     [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3] 

and - takes a list of boolean values and returns T/F depending if values test either
	ghci> and $ map (>4) [5,6,7,8]  
	>     True  
	ghci> and $ map (==4) [4,4,4,3,4]  
	>     False 

or - similar to and, if one value passes it gives T
	ghci> or $ map (==4) [2,3,4,5,6,1]  
	>     True  

any and all - can be used to replace and/or to simplify having to use map

iterate - (a -> a) -> a -> [a]. It takes a function and iterates it over a starting value. (Used with take)
	ghci> take 10 $ iterate (*2) 1  
	>     [1,2,4,8,16,32,64,128,256,512]

splitAt - takes a number n and a list and splits the list into two at the index n
	ghci> splitAt 3 "heyman"  
	>     ("hey","man")

takeWhile - takes elements from a list while it satisfies a condition.
	ghci> takeWhile (>3) [6,5,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,5,4,3,2,1]  
	>     [6,5,4] 

dropWhile - similar to takeWhile but drops element if True, then once element is false, returns the rest

span - like takeWhile except the excess droped from take while is actually remembered here
	ghci> let (fw, rest) = span (/=' ') "This a sentence" in "First word:" ++ fw ++ ", the rest:" ++ rest  
	>     "First word: This, the rest: a sentence" 

break - similar to span but breaks when first true, keeping excess
	ghci> break (==4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
	>     ([1,2,3],[4,5,6,7])  
	ghci> span (/=4) [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]  
	>     ([1,2,3],[4,5,6,7]) 

sort - sorts a list of type Ord
	ghci> sort [8,5,3,2,1,6,4,2]  
	>     [1,2,2,3,4,5,6,8] 

inits and tails - similar to init and tail, these are recursive over a given list
	ghci> let w = "w00t" in zip (inits w) (tails w)  
	>     [("","w00t"),("w","00t"),("w0","0t"),("w00","t"),("w00t","")]
  
isInfixOf - takes a list and checks if its in another list, returns Boolean
	ghci> "cat" `isInfixOf` "im a cat burglar"  
	>     True 

isPrefixOf and isSuffixOf - both search for a sublist, the former at the beginning and the ladder at the end
	ghci> "hey" `isPrefixOf` "hey there!"  
	>     True 
	ghci> "there!" `isSuffixOf` "oh hey there!"  
	>     True  

elem and notElem - check if an element is inside a list or not

partition - takes a predicate and a list and returns two lists one containing T element and one with F
	ghci> partition (>3) [1,3,5,6,3,2,1,0,3,7]  
	>     ([5,6,7],[1,3,3,2,1,0,3]) 


NOTE: Partition scans the whole of a list, whereas functions like span and break only check until failure


find seems straight forwards except for the Maybe thing. 

":
find - takes a list and a predicate and returns the first element that satisfies the predicate. It returns that element wrapped in a Maybe value. 

Maybe value can either be Just something or Nothing. A maybe value can be either no elements or a single element.

ghci> find (>4) [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
Just 5  
ghci> find (>9) [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
Nothing  
ghci> :t find  
find :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> Maybe a

:"

Maybe can only contain one element or no elements

elemIndex - looks for an element in a list. Returns a Maybe value too
	ghci> 4 `elemIndex` [1,2,3,4,5,6]  
	>     Just 3 

elemIndices - similar to elemIndex, but searches for all occourances
	ghci> ' ' `elemIndices` "Where are the spaces?"  
	>     [5,9,13] 

findIndex and findIndices - return the index of the first occurring and all occurrences respectively
	ghci> findIndex (==4) [5,3,2,1,6,4]  
	>     Just 5 
	ghci> findIndices (`elem` ['A'..'Z']) "Where Are The Caps?"  -- searches for occurrences of a capital
	>     [0,6,10,14] 

For zipping more than two lists together (i.e. more than jsut zip and zipWith):
	zip3 and zip4
	zipWith3 and zipWith4
   these numbers go up to 7

	ghci> zipWith3 (\x y z -> x + y + z) [1,2,3] [4,5,2,2] [2,2,3]  -- adds value at index 0, 1, 2 
	>     [7,9,8] 


**
lines - good for dealing with input, [string] -> [[string]]. takes a list of strings and breaks it into       **								multiple lists of strings (or lines)

	ghci> lines "first line\nsecond line\nthird line"  
	>     ["first line","second line","third line"] 

\n - character for a 'unix newline'

unlines - inverse of lines, takes list of strings and combines them into one string with '\n' between them

words and unwords - split a line of text into words and joins words into a line of text
	ghci> words "hey these are the words in this sentence"  
	>     ["hey","these","are","the","words","in","this","sentence"]  
	ghci> unwords ["hey","there","mate"]  
	>     "hey there mate"

nub - takes in a list and returns a list the same as the input except all duplicate items have been removed
	ghci> nub [1,2,3,4,3,2,1,2,3,4,3,2,1]  
	>     [1,2,3,4]  

delete - takes an element and a list and deletes the first occurrence of the element

\\ - the list difference function, takes two lists, a and b, and removes elements in b from a
	ghci> [1..10] \\ [2,5,9]  
	>     [1,3,4,6,7,8,10]

union - combines two lists, a and b, on the final element of list a, but removes duplicates from list b
	ghci> [1..7] `union` [5..10]  
	>     [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]  	-- note how elements 5,6,7 were removed from list b when it joined a

intersect - takes two lists and returns elements in both lists
	ghci> [1..7] `intersect` [5..10]  
	>     [5,6,7] 

insert :: (Ord a) => a -> [a] -> [a]. Inserts an element into the first position of one that is <= to it
	ghci> insert 4 [3,5,1,2,8,2]  
	>     [3,4,5,1,2,8,2]


Generic functions (by group):

genericLength, genericTake, genericDrop, genericSplitAt, genericIndex and genericReplicate
	These functions are the same as length, take, drop, splitAt, !! and replicate, however 
	are ueful when wanting to work with Intergral or Num typeclasses

> let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / length xs -- cannot use '/' on sum xs / length xs since length gives an Int
-- so generic function from Data.List is useful
> let xs = [1..6] in sum xs / genericLength xs

nubBy, deleteBy, unionBy, intersectBy and groupBy
	nub, delete, union, intersect and group's generic counterparts
	These are useful as the regular ones test with '==' where as generic use inequality functions and '=='

sortBy, insertBy, maximumBy and minimumBy
	sort, insert, maximum and minimum's generics
	They take a function that determine if one element is greater, smaller or equal to the other


/FOR REMAINING NOTES THE OFFICAL DOCUMENTATION IS LISTED FOR MODULES. AS WELL, SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS/

Functions in Data.Char: (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Data-Char.html)

isLower - checks whether a character is lower-cased
isUpper - checks whether a character is upper-cased
isAlphaNum - checks whether a character is a letter or a number
isDigit - checks whether a character is a digit
isLetter - checks whether a character is a letter
isNumber - checks whether a character is numeric

Q: confused about generalCategory

toUpper - converts a character to upper-case, all others are unchanged
toLower - converts a character to lower-case


Functions in Data.Map: (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.4.0.0/docs/Data-Map.html)

lookup - finds the paired element given one element in the pair, i.e.:
> phoneBook = 
>     [("amelia","555-2938")  
>     ,("freya","452-2928")  
>     ,("isabella","493-2928")  
>     ,("neil","205-2928")  
>     ,("roald","939-8282")  
>     ,("tenzing","853-2492")  
>     ]  

> findKey :: (Eq k) => k -> [(k,v)] -> Maybe v  
> findKey key = foldr (\(k,v) acc -> if key == k then Just v else acc) Nothing  

ghci> findKey "tenzing" phoneBook  
>     Just "853-2492"  
ghci> findKey "amelia" phoneBook  
>     Just "555-2938"  
ghci> findKey "christopher" phoneBook  
>     Nothing 

fromList - takes an association list and returns a map with the same associations
toList - the inverse of fromList
empty - an empty map, takes no arguments, returns an empty map
insert - a -> [a] -> [a]. Returns a new map that's just like the old one, only with the key and value inserted
null - checks if a map is empty
size - returns the size of the map
member - takes a key and a map and returns whether the key is in the map or not

fromListWith - acts like fromList but allows for an additional function for dealing with duplicates
> phoneBookToMap :: (Ord k) => [(k, String)] -> Map.Map k String  
> phoneBookToMap xs = Map.fromListWith (\number1 number2 -> number1 ++ ", " ++ number2) xs  


Functions in Data.Set (https://hackage.haskell.org/package/containers-0.7/docs/Data-Set.html)

*Since functions in Data.Set overlap with Prelude, we must do a qualified import:
> import qualified Data.Set as Set  

intersection - to see which elements two sets both share
difference - to see which elements in two sets are different, depending on order input


How to create your own moduel:

> module Geometry  
> ( cuboidArea
> , cuboidVolume  
> ) where  
    
> cuboidVolume :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float  
> cuboidVolume a b c = rectangleArea a b * c  
  
> cuboidArea :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float  
> cuboidArea a b c = rectangleArea a b * 2 + rectangleArea a c * 2 + rectangleArea c b * 2  
  
> rectangleArea :: Float -> Float -> Float  
> rectangleArea a b = a * b  

-- NOTE: rectangleArea is never made part of the moduel but is stil used by moduel parts

To import your moduel:

> import Geometry

-- NOTE: Geometry.hs has to be in the same folder that the program that's importing it is in



LYAH Ch 8 Notes:


Types and type classes:

> data Bool = False | True

| - or
data - new data type

> data Shape = Circle Float Float Float | Rectangle Float Float Float Float  

ghci> :t Circle  
> Circle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape  
ghci> :t Rectangle  
> Rectangle :: Float -> Float -> Float -> Float -> Shape  

driving _ - makes type of '_'
show - type

adding deriving (show) makes what's before it show-able


Record syntax:

make a superclass Person with types for a fName, lName, age, height(cm), phone#, fav flavor:

> data Person = Person String String Int Float String String deriving (Show) 

> firstName :: Person -> String  
> firstName (Person firstname _ _ _ _ _) = firstname  
  
> lastName :: Person -> String  
> lastName (Person _ lastname _ _ _ _) = lastname  
  
> age :: Person -> Int  
> age (Person _ _ age _ _ _) = age  
  
> height :: Person -> Float  
> height (Person _ _ _ height _ _) = height  
  
> phoneNumber :: Person -> String  
> phoneNumber (Person _ _ _ _ number _) = number  
  
> flavor :: Person -> String  
> flavor (Person _ _ _ _ _ flavor) = flavor  

ghci> let guy = Person "Buddy" "Finklestein" 43 184.2 "526-2928" "Chocolate"  
ghci> firstName guy  
> "Buddy"  
ghci> height guy  
> 184.2  
ghci> flavor guy  
> "Chocolate"  

-- it can be written as:

> data Person = Person { firstName :: String  
>                      , lastName :: String  
>                      , age :: Int  
>                      , height :: Float  
>                      , phoneNumber :: String  
>                      , flavor :: String  
>                      } deriving (Show)


data Vector = Vector Int Int Int	- 3D vector


Type parameters:

> data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a
> data Vector a = Vector a a a deriving (Show)

> vplus :: (Num t) => Vector t -> Vector t -> Vector t  
> (Vector i j k) `vplus` (Vector l m n) = Vector (i+l) (j+m) (k+n)  
  
> vectMult :: (Num t) => Vector t -> t -> Vector t  
> (Vector i j k) `vectMult` m = Vector (i*m) (j*m) (k*m)  
  
> scalarMult :: (Num t) => Vector t -> Vector t -> t  
> (Vector i j k) `scalarMult` (Vector l m n) = i*l + j*m + k*n

ghci> Vector 3 5 8 `vplus` Vector 9 2 8  
> Vector 12 7 16  

Derived instances - when a type is derived from another type class
	i.e. how Int is derived from the Eq typeclass

> data Person = Person { firstName :: String  
>                      , lastName :: String  
>                      , age :: Int  
>                      } deriving (Eq, Show, Read)

read - opposite of show, converts values of type a -> String

> ghci> read "Person {firstName =\"Michael\", lastName =\"Diamond\", age = 43}" :: Person  
> Person {firstName = "Michael", lastName = "Diamond", age = 43}

Ord - typeclass implying a set of orderable items

> data Bool = False | True deriving (Ord)  

ghci> True `compare` False  
> GT  	-- implying greater than 'T > F'

Enum - typeclass implying a set of items with predecessors and successors
Bounded - typeclass implying a set of items whom have a lowest and highest possible value
Eq - typeclass implying the items are able to be tested for equality

> data Day = Monday | Tuesday | Wednesday | Thursday | Friday | Saturday | Sunday  
>            deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, Read, Bounded, Enum) 

Show/Read:
ghci> show Wednesday  
> "Wednesday"  
ghci> read "Saturday" :: Day  
> Saturday 

Eq/Ord:
ghci> Saturday == Saturday  
> True  
ghci> Saturday > Friday  
> True 

Bounded:
ghci> minBound :: Day  
> Monday  
ghci> maxBound :: Day  
> Sunday 

Enum:
ghci> pred Saturday  
> Friday  
ghci> [Thursday .. Sunday]  
> [Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday]


Type synonyms:
type String = [Char]
-- do nothing but make code easier to comprehend
> type Name = datatype 

-- Example of a linear search look-up
> import qualified Data.Map as Map    
> data LockerState = Taken | Free deriving (Show, Eq)  
> type Code = String  
> type LockerMap = Map.Map Int (LockerState, Code) 

> lockerLookup :: Int -> LockerMap -> Either String Code  
> lockerLookup lockerNumber map = 
>     case Map.lookup lockerNumber map of  
>         Nothing -> Left $ "Locker number " ++ show lockerNumber ++ " doesn't exist!"  
>         Just (state, code) -> if state /= Taken  
>                                 then Right code  
>                                 else Left $ "Locker " ++ show lockerNumber ++ " is already taken!" 

Recursive Data Structures:
	Lists:
		[1,2,3,4,5] == 1:(2:(3:(4:(5:[]))))

Cons:
-- Empty is like []
> 4 `Cons` (5 `Cons` Empty)
> 4:(5:[])

":-:" - fixity declaration
> infixr 5 :-:
> data List a = Empty | a :-: (List a) deriving (Show, Read, Eq, Ord)  
This puts 5 on front of Empty or infront of other elements into a list

Typeclasses 102:

prelude def of Eq:
> class Eq a where  
>     (==) :: a -> a -> Bool  
>     (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool  
>     x == y = not (x /= y)  
>     x /= y = not (x == y)  -- used so that we don't have to specify cases where x /= (not equal) y

> data TrafficLight = Red | Yellow | Green  

> instance Eq TrafficLight where  
>     Red == Red = True  
>     Green == Green = True  
>     Yellow == Yellow = True  
>     _ == _ = False  

> instance (Eq m) => Eq (Maybe m) where  -- using a class constraint to make m of Eq and of Maybe
>     Just x == Just y = x == y  
>     Nothing == Nothing = True  
>     _ == _ = False  

Yes/No typeclass:
> class YesNo a where  
>     yesno :: a -> Bool  

> instance YesNo Int where  -- Int is of class YesNo and returns if Int is any number other than 0
>     yesno 0 = False  
>     yesno _ = True  

> instance YesNo (Maybe a) where  -- YesNo version of Maybe a
>     yesno (Just _) = True  
>     yesno Nothing = False 

Functor:
used for things that can be mapped over

takes thing a and applies function (a -> b) on it turning it into thing b

> class Functor f where  
>     fmap :: (a -> b) -> f a -> f b  

> instance Functor [] where  -- instance for lists
>     fmap = map  


Type constructor - takes types as parameters to produce concrete types

ghci> :k Int  -- :k - examines the type of given
> Int :: *  -- * - the type is concrete (takes no parameters and only values of a concrete type)

Types and Kinds are different - :t isUpper > Char -> Bool, :t isUpper 'A' > Bool; but kind is * both
